## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
C++ Compiler (g++, msvc)
CMake
Make or NMake
Visual Studio Code or QTCreator
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Open project folder in Visual Studio Code or Qt Creator
run cmake (the best way to run it from an extra build dir)
run make/nmake
```

For an example you can also see the .travis.yml File.
